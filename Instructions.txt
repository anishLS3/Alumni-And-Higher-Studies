Here's how you set it up:
1) Download & extract all the files.
2) Keep MongoDB open, and go to the data folder in the app. 
3) Delete existing ProfileDB (database name) in MongoDB.
4) Run dataLoader.py 
5) If you get any missing package error, just pip install that package. 
    Keep doing this until you install the necessary packages.
6) After execution, check once in MongoDB whether everything is loaded.
7) cd to alumnator_api, and execute "npm run dev"
8) cd to alumnator, and execute "npm run dev"
9) If you get any error in Steps 7-8, then delete the node_modules folder 
    in the respective directory (alumnator_api / alumnator), and perform "npm install".
