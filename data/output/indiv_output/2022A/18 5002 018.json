            "desc": "Fake news production, accessibility, and consumption have all increased with the rise of internet-connected gadgets and social media platforms. A good fake news detection system is essential because the news readers receive can affect their opinions. Several works on fake news detection have been done using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Recently, the deep learning approach has been preferred over machine learning because of its ability to comprehend the intricacies of textual data. The introduction of transformer architecture changed the NLP paradigm and distinguished itself from recurrent models by enabling the processing of sentences as a whole rather than word by word. The attention mechanisms introduced in Transformers allowed them to understand the relationship between far-apart tokens in a sentence. Numerous deep learning works on fake news detection have been published by focusing on different features to determine the authenticity of a news source. We performed an extensive analysis of the comprehensive NELA-GT 2020 dataset, which revealed that the title and content of a news source contain discernible information critical for determining its integrity. To this objective, we introduce 'FakeNews Transformer' \u2014 a specialized Transformer-based architecture that considers the news story's title and content to assess its veracity. Our proposed work achieved an accuracy of 74.0% on a subset of the NELA-GT 2020 dataset. To our knowledge, FakeNews Transformer is the first published work that considers both title and content for evaluating a news article; thus, we compare the performance of our work against two BERT and two LSTM models working independently on title and content. Our work outperformed the BERT and LSTM models working independently on title by 7.6% and 9.6%, while performing better than the BERT and LSTM models working independently on content by 8.9% and 10.5%, respectively.",

However, relatively fewer research is being carried out in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for languages with low resources. We present a method to develop speech recognition model with minimal resources using Mozilla DeepSpeech architecture. We have utilized freely available online computational resources for training, enabling similar approaches to be carried out for research in a low-resourced languages in a financially constrained environments. We also present novel ways to build an efficient language model from publicly available web resources to improve accuracy in ASR. The proposed ASR model gives the best result of 24.7% Word Error Rate (WER), compared to 55% WER by Google speech-to-text. We have also demonstrated a semi supervised development of speech corpus using our trained ASR model, indicating a cost effective approach of building large vocabulary corpus for low resource language. The trained Tamil ASR model and the training sets are released in public domain and are available on GitHub.",

            "desc": "Sign Language Translation (SLT) is an important sequence-to-sequence problem that has been challenging to solve, because of the various factors which influence the meaning of a sign. In this paper, we implement a Multi Context Transformer architecture that attempts to solve this problem by operating on batched video segment representations called context vectors, intending to capture various temporal dependencies present between the frames to accurately translate the input signs. This architecture, being end-to-end also eliminates the need for sign language intermediaries known as glosses. Our model produces results that are on par with the state-of-the-art (98.19% score retention in the ROUGE-L score and 86.65% in the BLEU-4 score) while simultaneously achieving a 30.88% reduction in model parameters, which makes the model suitable for real-world applications. Our implementation is available on GitHub.",
